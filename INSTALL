Installation instructions:

* Install the dependencies: Scala 2.7, Sun Java JDK 6, libmysql-java

** JS: if you install an ubunutu 10.04 server, you'll need to enable the 'partner' ubuntu source directory for apt-get to be able to install the sun java

* Uninstall gcj if it's installed as it seems to interfere with the
  Scala compiler. You can safely reinstall it after compiling Etherpad
  if you want to.

* Edit the files bin/build.sh and bin/run.sh (and optionally
  bin/etherpad.init.d) and change the paths to match your system.

* Run bin/build.sh

* Create a new user on your system called "etherpad"

* JS: sudo useradd etherpad

* Create a MySQL database "etherpad" and a database user "etherpad"

* JS: login into the mysql command line client, and use these commands
* JS: create user etherpad identified by 'etherpass';
* JS:  create database etherpad;
* JS: grant all on *.* to 'etherpad'@'%' identified by 'etherpass';
* JS: you may have to change localhost to IP address in the properties config depending on mysql setup

* Copy etherpad/etc/etherpad.localdev-default.properties to etherpad/etc/etherpad.local.properties

* Edit etherpad/etc/etherpad.local.properties and set
   etherpad.SQL_JDBC_URL
       Example etherpad.SQL_JDBC_URL = jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/etherpad
   etherpad.SQL_PASSWORD
   etherpad.SQL_USERNAME = etherpad
   etherpad.adminPass
   topdomains
       Example: topdomains = yourhostname.com,localhost
       
* JS: Be sure to add a hosts entry on your machine that points to your VM and an IP in the list

* JS: this stuff below doesn't work. run "bin/run.sh" to fire up the server

* Create a link to bin/etherpad.init.d from /etc/init.d/etherpad

* Run /etc/init.d/etherpad start
